# clashBOT
A custom-made Discord bot for the running of the 24 Hour Game 2021!

Please note that certain things have been REDACTED (discord ids, bot token), and there should be a corresponding sheetkey.json when running this bot (which can be pulled when setting up a bot with google's sheets api). If you want to use parts of this bot or ask questions about it, feel free to go ham! This bot is NOT generalisable in the slightest, and so heavy editing would be required to do anything useful with this bot.
